                <p><b>Research｜Information Architecture｜UI Design</b></p><br><br>
                <p>Dickson Bros Co. is an established hardware store located near Harvard Square in Cambridge, MA. The business has an existing website. The goal of this project is to upgrade the website and incorporate a carting function.<br>
                <br>I used the double diamond model as my design process. The project took two weeks to finish.<br>
                <br>In this project, I examined user mental models, learned common design patterns, and deployed several techniques for usability testing.</p>

                <P>Due to the two-week time constraint, I started with evaluative and generative researches in tandem.<br>
                <br>I first conducted heuristic evaluation on the existing website, and uncovered 22 usability issues, 5 of which were medium to severe ones that prevented customers from completing a task.</p>

                <p>I then visited True Value&reg;, The Home Depot&reg; and Office Depot&reg; for comparative analysis, and discovered common patterns on icons, social integration and page layout. I incorporated these conventions in my design works.<br>

                <hr class="cs-break">
                <p>Contextual inquiries and user interviews were done to gain insight from target customers. For a logistic reason, I also asked participants to card sort immediately after the interview. Results were then analyzed to narrow user problems and create information architecture.</p>

                <br>
                <p>One particular problem was the exasperation on purchasing &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; products, which became a main focus for my problem statement. Some findings for edge use also intrigued me. But I decided to leave those concerns for later.<br>

                <br><br>
                <br>The biggest challenge of this project was its information architecture (IA). Dickson Bros carries over 5000 SKUs in its inventory, ranging from consumer housewares to industrial hardware. Many ambiguities existed in classifications.<br>
                <br>After analysis of all card sort results based on 100 samples, it was still hard to find a mutually exclusive classification system. So I moved on to examine the mental model of my target customers, working around my way to explore alternative solutions for the IA.<br>

                <p>To address the pain point discovered in user interviews, I introduced a product review page with extensive information. This helps customer build confidence when placing an order.</p><br>

                <br><p>Iterations were made based on user feedbacks. Here I list two major changes that improve the usability.</p>
                <br><p>Initially, categories were listed alphabetically. Giving the IA ambiguity, most participants clicked a wrong category. To fix this problem, I re-ordered them based on specificity, so users would see specific categories before generic ones when scanning from the top.</p><br>
